# Variant-Calling-from-SARS-CoV-2-Nanopore-Sequencing-Data-Using-Cloud-Computing

Abstract

This study investigates the application of cloud computing for variant detection in SARS-CoV-2 Nanopore sequencing datasets. By deploying Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) and Apache Spark, we demonstrate enhanced computational efficiency, scalability, and reproducibility relative to conventional high-performance computing (HPC) environments.

Introduction

The identification of genomic variants from Nanopore sequencing data presents significant computational challenges, particularly due to the demands of accurate read alignment, variant detection, and subsequent data filtering. Traditional HPC infrastructures, while powerful, often encounter scalability limitations and incur substantial costs. Cloud computing platforms, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), offer a dynamic, scalable, and cost-effective alternative for large-scale bioinformatics workflows.

Materials and Methods

Data Acquisition
	•	Dataset: Publicly available dataset PRJNA750736, comprising 15 SARS-CoV-2 Nanopore sequencing samples.
	•	Storage and Access: All sequencing data were uploaded to AWS S3 buckets to facilitate seamless integration with cloud-based computational resources.
	•	Sample Size: Approximately 30 megabytes per sample.

Preprocessing on HPC

Initial quality control was conducted on a local HPC system. Specifically:
	•	Read quality was assessed using FASTQC.
	•	Adapter sequences and low-quality bases were removed using Trim Galore.

Cloud Computing Environment
	•	Preprocessed sequencing reads and the reference genome were transferred to AWS S3.
	•	An Amazon EMR cluster was provisioned and configured with Apache Spark to enable distributed data processing across multiple compute nodes.

Variant Calling Workflow
	•	Reads were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome using Minimap2.
	•	Alignment files were converted from SAM to BAM format utilizing Samtools.
	•	Variant calling, including the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels), was performed using LoFreq.
	•	The complete pipeline execution was carried out on the EMR cluster within the cloud infrastructure.

Results

The cloud-based variant calling workflow achieved completion within approximately one hour, whereas the equivalent pipeline executed on an HPC system required approximately two hours. This finding underscores the potential of cloud computing to significantly reduce processing time for computationally intensive bioinformatics applications.

Software and Computational Tools
	•	Cloud Services: Amazon S3 (storage), Amazon EC2 (compute), AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon EMR (managed Hadoop framework).
	•	Bioinformatics Tools: Minimap2 (alignment), Samtools (file conversion), LoFreq (variant detection), FASTQC (quality control), Trim Galore (trimming).
	•	Big Data Framework: Apache Spark for distributed data handling and computational parallelism.

Conclusion

The integration of cloud computing into SARS-CoV-2 variant detection workflows offers a viable and efficient alternative to traditional HPC infrastructures. By leveraging scalable resources and distributed computing frameworks, cloud-based platforms can substantially enhance the speed, flexibility, and reproducibility of bioinformatics analyses.
